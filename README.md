# Komisio Mobile

Mobile app for [Komisio](https://github.com/Komisio/komisio), the consignment
platform for second-hand stores. Built with Expo and React Native.

> Status: store picker, login with two-step verification, profile, and the
> store catalogue with item detail (S10/S11), and store information (S12). My items, overview and money
> are still placeholders (see `docs/screens.md`).

## Direction

- **Thin client.** The platform (`Komisio/komisio`) is the source of truth.
  The app validates forms and keeps drafts; the server checks permissions,
  agreements, amounts and state changes.
- **Sign-in** with Supabase Auth. **Writes and server flows** go through a
  small mobile API in the platform that reuses the same server functions as the
  web. Direct Supabase reads only for named, reviewed read functions.
- **Screen by screen.** Screens from the earlier app are the design reference;
  the owner decides per screen and function what to keep, change, remove or
  postpone before it is built here. The decisions for version 1 are in
  [`docs/screens.md`](docs/screens.md).
- **Older app versions keep working** for a defined support period, and retried
  commands never create duplicate operations.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js 22.13+, 24.3+ or 26+, as declared in `engines` in
`package.json`. `.nvmrc` selects Node 24 (`nvm use`).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and point it at a Komisio platform
(local Supabase or staging). Only public client values belong there.

```bash
npm install
npm start          # Expo dev server
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm test           # unit tests (node:test)
```

Routes live in `src/app/`; keep components, hooks and utilities outside it.
See `AGENTS.md` for Expo conventions.

## Store catalogue (S10/S11)

The Store tab uses the reviewed `store_catalogue` and `store_catalogue_item`
RPCs from [platform PR #715](https://github.com/Komisio/komisio/pull/715).
The connected platform needs that migration and the store must opt into app
visibility. The signed-in account must match exactly one seller in that store;
the server derives that identity from the session. These reads take the tenant
ID, not a client-supplied seller ID.

Search matches titles and categories. The two-column list loads 30 rows at a
time; the detail shows the current price, descriptive facts and photos. Changes
to store/account discard the previous view. Returning to the catalogue refreshes
all loaded pages in place, keeping the list mounted and its scroll position.
Network failures retain the rows for retry; denied access clears them. A new
search resets the list. Favourites and category filter chips are outside this slice.

Photos use authenticated Storage URLs with the current session token. No public
or signed URL is stored, and Expo Image's persistent cache is disabled. Failed
detail images can be retried. The original S10/S11 screenshots are available in
[reference PR #4](https://github.com/Komisio/komisio-mobile/pull/4).

Unit tests cover stale requests, pagination, revoked access and the read
contract. Native-device behavior, real Storage downloads and staging must also
be verified before release; successful JavaScript export alone does not verify
those paths.

## Store information (S12)

Open **Store information** from the Store tab for published descriptions,
address, contact details and opening hours. This uses the existing public
`public_store_profile(p_slug)` RPC; no new database migration is needed.
Store changes discard the previous response, and focus/retry reads can be cancelled.
Unpublished information and missing opening hours are shown explicitly; a missing
weekday does not mean closed. Store-authored text remains in its published language.

The map button opens the published address in an external map; it does not
request device location. Contact actions allow only HTTPS websites, plain email
addresses and phone numbers, and show an error if the destination cannot open.
The S12 reference is in [reference PR #4](https://github.com/Komisio/komisio-mobile/pull/4).
Hand-in actions remain postponed. Browser navigation, large text and native
map/phone/email hand-offs still need interactive verification before release.
